### Description

📝 React 18 introduced a fundamental change in Strict Mode. Strict Mode is also enabled by default when you start your project with _create-react-app_. You should try to make your project work _without_ the fix provided in this repository, but when all else fails, this fix will keep the useEffect double call from wreaking havoc.
